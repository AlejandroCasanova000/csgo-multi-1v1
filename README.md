csgo-multi-1v1
=======================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/splewis/csgo-multi-1v1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/splewis/csgo-multi-1v1)

This is home of my CS:GO multi-1v1 arena plugin. It sets up any number of players in 1v1-situations on specially made maps and they fight in a ladder-type system. The winners move up, the losers go down.

Work toward a stable 1.0.0 is underway. Note that is readme reflects the 1.0.0 development version, rather than the latest release's readme.

Also see the [AlliedModders thread](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=241056).

### Features
- Round types: there are 3 round types: rifle, pistol, and awp
- Player selection: players can select to allow pistol and awp rounds or ban them, rifle rounds are always allowed
- Player preference: players can also select a preference of round type, if player preferences match they will play that type
- Weapon selection: players can select their primary (i.e. their rifle) and their pistol
- Armor on pistol rounds: helmets are taken away, and kevlar is also taken away if the player selected an upgraded pistol
- Optional flashbangs: players can select to "allow flashbangs" - if both players allow them, they each get 1
- ELO ranking system: optionally, player statistics can be stored in a database, see below for details

### For plugin developers
Work to make the plugin extensible is currently underway (and **not released**). For a preview, check [multi1v1.inc](csgo/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/multi1v1.inc).

The general idea of everything I do with sourcemod plugins is to **keep it simple, stupid**. This plugin and its implementation details are no exception.

### Plugin modules
A few plugin modules, created using the include above, are also included. They are all optional and included in the download under ``plugins/disabled``.

- **multi1v1_sprweight**: provides a weight function used by my [smart-player-reports](https://github.com/splewis/smart-player-reports) plugin
- **multi1v1_elomatcher**: provides a different way of ordering players rather than a ladder by matching up similar elo ratings
- **multi1v1_quietmode**: makes it so players can only hear and talk to the opponents in their arena

These modules, and any other ideas you have, are relatively simple and are easy to contribute to. Feel free to implement one and send a pull request.


### Download
Stable releases are in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-multi-1v1/releases) section.

I **strongly** recommend using the [Updater](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=169095) plugin which can automatically update the plugin for bug fixes.
Any changes made through an automatic update will be backwards compatible.


### Installation

**Only Sourcemod 1.6 is supported.** Releases are compiled using the 1.6 compiler and will not work on a server using 1.5. The reason for this is a change to how floating point values are handled, see the  [1.6 release notes](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/SourceMod_1.6.0_Release_Notes#Compatibility_Issues) for details.

If you only want the plugin, either download **multi1v1.zip** or build it yourself.
It should contain the plugin binary (**plugins/multi1v1.smx**) and the default game config (**cfg/sourcemod/multi1v1/game_cvars.cfg**).
Extract these to the appropriate folders, tweak game_cvars.cfg if you want. The file **cfg/sourcemod/multi1v1/multi1v1.cfg** will be autogenerated when the plugin is first run and you can tweak it if you wish.

Any other files (e.g. the module plugins provided) are all optional.


### Web Interface
There is a work-in-progress open-source web interface being developed under the [web](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-multi-1v1/tree/master/web) directory. Check its [readme](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-multi-1v1/blob/master/web/readme.md) for more details.


### Building
The build process is managed by the Makefile.

		make          # builds the .smx file
		make clean    # clears .smx files, .zip files
		make package  # packages the files to multi1v1.zip

To compile, you will need:
- [SMLib](http://www.sourcemodplugins.org/smlib/)
- [Updater](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=169095)


### Maps
I have a [workshop collection](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=249376192) of maps I know of. The "am_" prefix stands for aim_multi, reflecting the fact that the maps are similar to aim_ maps but there are multiple copies of them.

Guidelines for making a multi-1v1 map:
- Create 1 arena and test it well, and when are you happy copy it
- Create bunch of arenas, I'd recommend making at least **16**
- The players shouldn't be able to see each other on spawn
- Each group of spawns (e.g. all CT spawns in arena 1) must be within 1600.0 units of each other, this is required to cluster spawns into the arenas and not configurable
- Ensure that the arenas are sufficiently far apart so players don't hear shooting in other arenas
- If you want to edit your map, it's easiest to delete all but 1 arena and re-copy them. Be warned this can cause issues with the game's lighting and clients may crash the first time they load the new map if they had downloaded the old one previously
- You should avoid areas where it's easy for 1 player to hide; ideally they should have to cover multiple angles if they sit in one spot
- Here is an example map: [am_grass2.vmf](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/76035852/am_grass2.zip)
- The cvar ``sm_multi1v1_verbose_spawns`` can be set to 1 to log information about how the spawns were partitioned into arenas


### Using the statistics database
You should add a database named mult1v1 to your databases.cfg file like so:

	"multi1v1"
	{
		"driver"			"mysql"
		"host"				"123.123.123.123"	// localhost works too
		"database"			"game_servers_database"
		"user"				"mymulti1v1server"
		"pass"				"strongpassword"
		"timeout"			"10"
		"port"			"3306"	// whatever port MySQL is set up on, 3306 is default
	}

To create a MySQL user and database on the database server, you can run:

	CREATE DATABASE game_servers_database;
	CREATE USER 'mymulti1v1server'@'123.123.123.123' IDENTIFIED BY 'strongpassword';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON game_servers_database.multi1v1_stats TO 'mymulti1v1server'@'123.123.123.123';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Make sure to change the IP, the username, and the password. You should probably change the database as well, especially if you already have one set up you can use.

Schema:

	mysql> describe multi1v1_stats;
	+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
	| Field        | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
	+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
	| accountID    | int(11)     | NO   | PRI | 0       |       |
	| auth         | varchar(64) | NO   |     |         |       |
	| name         | varchar(64) | NO   |     |         |       |
	| wins         | int(11)     | NO   |     | 0       |       |
	| losses       | int(11)     | NO   |     | 0       |       |
	| rating       | float       | NO   |     | 1500    |       |
	| lastTime     | int         | NO   |     | 0       |       |
	| recentRounds | int         | NO   |     | 0       |       |
	+--------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+


Note that the ``accountID`` field is what is returned by [GetSteamAccountID](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/SourceMod_1.5.0_API_Changes#Clients), which is "the lower 32 bits of the full 64-bit Steam ID (referred to as community id by some) and is unique per account."

``auth`` is the steam ID auth string, and the ``lastTime`` field is the last time the player connected to the server.
The time comes from [GetTime](http://docs.sourcemod.net/api/index.php?fastload=show&id=601&), which returns the "number of seconds since unix epoch".

``recentRounds`` is simply incremented each time the player completes a round. This can be used, for example, to check the rounds played on a daily basis and lower ratings if a player didn't play a certain number of rounds.


### Clientprefs Usage/Cookies
Player choices (round type preferences, weapon choices) can be saved so they persist across maps for players (via the SourceMod clientprefs API). Installing SQLite should be sufficient for this to work.

If you have a game-hosting specific provider, they may already have SQLite installed


### Contribution and Suggestions
