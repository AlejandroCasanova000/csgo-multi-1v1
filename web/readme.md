Multi 1v1 Arena Web Stats Interface
=======================================

###Configuration
Edit connect.inc.php with your appropriate database credentials, page title and Steam Web API key.

###In-Game Stats
A feature for this was not included in the base plugin, but a way to do it has been mentioned [here](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2147002&postcount=10).
Replace the URL with something like "http://www.domain.com/stats/redirect.php?id=".

###Web Interface
The web interface is not really polished, this was just a quick days job I did as I was learning PHP.
