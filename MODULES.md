There is a major work-in-progress switch to make the plugin modular. This would allow others to more easily tweak the functionality without having to create a fork.

Everything related is completely subject to change until a 1.0.0 release.

For a preview:
 - check the [include](csgo/addons/sourcemod/scripting/include/multi1v1.inc) for the natives available. These are implemented in [natives.sp](csgo/addons/sourcemod/scripting/multi1v1/natives.sp).
 - check the [example plugin](csgo/addons/sourcemod/scripting/multi1v1_example.sp) to see the new forwards available and some of the natives in use.
